**Toby is a schnauzer. He will fetch a
stick or a ball if you throw it,
but if you throw it again
he will just look at you.
He fetched it for you once!
Surely that's enough?**

Toby would be good at managing climate
and seasonal data. He likes to do a thing
once and do it properly.

It's helpful if each batch of data need only be downloaded
once, or as few times as possible. It's also helpful
if the same code can download data from multiple sources,
and apply the same processing and analysis steps.

This repository contains the open source version of
`schnauzer`. The full `schnauzer` code downloads,
processes, and analyses NCEP, JRA, and ERA5 analyses,
as well as GEFS or CFS forecasts. The code will
then check the data, regrid as desired,
calculate scaled anomalies, and if appropriate
obtain a set of principal components for use
in further analysis.

This public version demonstrates the download of
NCEP analysis data at the surface or on pressure
levels, and calculates from these a covariance
matrix and principal components
(sometimes called EOFs).
